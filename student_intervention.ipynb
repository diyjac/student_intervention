The output of this project is **discrete**:  **(class labels)**.  Either the student needs early intervention or not: a **boolean** that is linked a predicted label of **fail** to graduate.  A **regression** supervised learning problem involves continuous outputs: **(numbers)** and we are trying to find a **\"best fit line\"**, which does not fit the goal of this project.

This means that we should not unneccessarily choose a more complex model when a simpler model give us the same accuracy.\n",

To help narrow the search space for a what a *good question* to ask near the top of the tree to provide a good split of the decision boundaries, the concept of entropy is introduced.  Entropy is a measure of impurities in a bunch of examples where 0.0 entropy means that all of the samples belongs to one class, and 1.0 means maximum entropy and that the dataset can be evenly split between classes.  The **Decision Tree Classifier's** goal is to be able to find all of the features in the dataset that will produce maximum entropies to produce *good* splits near the top.  The mathematical formular for entropy is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Entropy=\\sum_{i} -p_{i} log_{2}( p_{i} )$$\n",

Afterwards, the training dataset is no longer needed, and the decision tree representation is used instead to predict the target concept, which, in this case, if a student may fail graduation and need early intervention.

This boundary or linear separator is also known as the *margin* and the maximum margin between the separation can be found using *Quadratic Programs*.  It was found that the *Quadratic Programs* used certain input data points within the dataset near the data separations to find the maximum margins as denoted by 2/||w|| in the diagram below.  These data points were called *Support Vectors*; and thus, the model is now known as a **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier (SVC)** because the learning model finds the *Support Vectors* to build the maximum margin separator.\n",

Its representation, training and prediction methods are the same as that of the *Decision Tree Classifier* as shown above in the **Decision Tree Classifier** section, but there are multiple of them, and their splits at the top may not be *good* since the feature they split on is set to *random* instead of *best*.

The training dataset will be given to the model to build the *Decision Tree* for our student intervention project, and the testing dataset will be use to score the accuracy of the generated *Decision Tree's* predictions.  Since the training dataset has historical data of prior students, the *Decision Tree Classifier* can search the dataset for patterns that led those students to either pass or fail their graduation.  When learning from the training set, the *Decision Tree Classifier* will use the randomness (noise) in the dataset to help it sort and group similar students together and separate them from dissimilar students. Each time it generates a new candidate group by asking a question in the dataset, the *Decision Tree Classifier* will evaluate the new candidate group on its effectiveness in getting closer to resolving whether its group of students will either pass or fail graduation.  If the grouping is effective, the *Decision Tree Classifier* will split the dataset into the subgroups and create a branching tree structure.  In general, the *Decision Tree Classifier* will prefer to generate groupings that will lead to correct pass|fail separations, follow by the large groupings, so as to determine a student's pass|fail prediction using the fewest steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the *Decision Tree Classifier* has resolved all grouping and generated a complete *Decision Tree*, predictions against new students can simply be obtained by applying the *Decision Tree* to the new students' information resulting in their pass or fail graduation predictions.  As can be seen, this is a simple model in both representation and execution while using our existing data, limited resources and budgets wisely.  We believe this new graduation prediction model will help the school district bring their graduation success rate up by identifying students that needs intervention early before graduation."

    "The final F<sub>1</sub> test score for the tuned **Decision Tree Classifier** is **0.8029**.  This means we were able to achieve better performance than the **Ensamble Methods: Random Forest Classifier** by **0.0177!**, while at the same time maintaining our prediction execution time at 0.0003 seconds per execution.  Overall, the major tuning parameter that made the difference was *max_depth*.  This tuning parameter prevents the **Decision Tree Classifier** from overfitting to the training dataset to increase bias to the training data and thus allow for lower variance with the testing data, and a better fit in general for the student population.\n",

For our purpose, I believe that our bias to having more false negatives than false positives are acceptable because we would rather be more proactive in extending intervention to our students showing any signs of not being able to pass their graduations."
